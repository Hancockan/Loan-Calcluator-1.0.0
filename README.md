# Loan-Calculator-1.0.0

This is an Android application that I made for fun. It took about a week to make and was a great learning experience. I published it to 
the Google play store in early march 2017.

To use it, the user inputs the principal amout of the loan, interest rate, and term and the application gives them an amortization table
with monthly payment amounts, interest amounts, and equity gain. When I get free time I plan on adding more features and then eventually 
marketing it.
